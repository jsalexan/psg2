# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this project to keep track of the many lessons learned by Bootcamp students doing the class prework.
In doing so, I've created a tool to help students study for the early weeks of Bootcamp, while at the same time teaching myself the ins and outs of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage

Each section contains helpful study facts about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Additionally, if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
